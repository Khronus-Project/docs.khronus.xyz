The purpose of the Alpha version is to refine the Khronus Protocol and interact with the community in order to establish what features are more needed by the industry prioritize development accordingly.

## What is available

From [date] the Krhonus Protocol is open to provide client contracts in the Polygon Mumbai testnet with alerts.

Use case for this service are contracts such as, parametric insurance, escrow agreements, lending, etc. 

The main characteristic of this type of smart contracts if that they support many parametric insurance policies, escrow agreements, or lending agreements. The Khronus Protocol can provide alerts to expiry each of them, once the original Smart Contract is registered in the protocol. 

Periodic alerts at different timeframes will be available soon to power decentralized cron tabs, such as the ones that are needed to automate applications related to staking and subscription payments. 

During the alpha version all scheduler servers (Khronus Nodes) are operated by the Khronus Project, in the near future the protocol might receive request for joining as an scheduler server operator.
